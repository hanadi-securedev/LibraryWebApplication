📚 Central City Library — Management System

Welcome to my Library Management System project!
This web application is designed for a modern library that wants to organize books, manage members, track borrowing activity, and simply provide a much smarter library experience 🚀

🌟 Project Idea

The Central City Library needed a digital system to replace manual work.
The goal was to build a system able to:

Store thousands of books

Manage branches across the city

Register members

Track borrowing/returning

Follow availability

Organize authors and publishers

Support staff operations

In short: I wanted to build the brain of a modern library 🧠📚

🛠 Technologies I used
Frontend

✨ HTML
✨ CSS
✨ JavaScript
✨ Bootstrap

Backend

🔥 C#
🔥 ASP.NET Core
🔥 Entity Framework
🔥 Code First approach

Database

📌 Microsoft SQL Server

I built all tables, relations, and migrations using Code First, after designing the ERD and schema first.

💡 What the system can do

Add / edit / update book details

Check book availability

Record borrowing transactions

Register library members

Manage staff accounts

Manage multiple branches

Organize genres & authors

Keep publisher information

Each entity has its own CRUD operations and relationships.

⚙ Architectural Notes

EF Core Code-First Approach

Clean entity relationships

Validations

Database migrations

Models built following real library entities

This project reflects real-world data modeling and domain-driven thinking instead of random database tables.

🔍 Why this project is meaningful

I wanted to build something not only “working”, but realistic.

📌 Multi-branch libraries
📌 Membership rules
📌 Borrowing transactions
📌 Book status tracking
📌 Professional ERD and schema
📌 Real publishing & author info

This simulates real libraries, not a basic CRUD app 🎯
